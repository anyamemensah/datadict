## datadict <a href='https://github.com/anyamemensah/datadict'></a>

**datadict** provides a focused toolset for creating and managing data
dictionaries. It allows users to:

- Document datasets by automatically extracting variable names, labels,
  and distributions.
- Restructure complex metadata, transforming delimited entries into
  tidy, row-per-value formats.
- Validate the integrity of dictionary mappings to ensure consistency
  for downstream analysis.
