**datadict** is an R package that provides a clean, consistent summary of a data frame or tibble's structure. Through its core function, `generate_dict()`, the package automates the extraction of variable metadata, including names, labels, data types, and distributions (such as unique values, value labels, and numeric ranges), producing a standardized reference that simplifies data exploration and documentation.
